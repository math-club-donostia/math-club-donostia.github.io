Principles of the club
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* Potential participation in an olympiad is only a motivation, but not a main goal.
* Thinking is the goal! Thinking is more important than knowledge.
* The way of getting to the knowledge is more important than the knowledge itself.
* Instead of reading a lecture on a theorem/method, the student rediscovers it on their own. The problems are just guidelines into this journey to the unknown.
* It is OK to fail. They are not expected to complete all problems with ease. Challenging the mind is the goal.
* It is OK to be wrong. Actually, it is GOOD to be wrong! Suggesting a wrong/incomplete solution is way better than not suggesting anything. Through the contradiction and argumented discussion we make our way for the correct solution. Yesterday I have heard a number of interesting theories on map coloring. Unfortunately I could not understand any of them, but it was very interesting to listen.
* Sometimes I (the teacher) may be wrong. And everyone (students, other teachers) is welcome to find and prove it!
* When I contradict a solution of a student, it is not because I am picky. That is to help finding a correct solution, or training to support their opinion.
* Well argumented discussion is the way of communication.
* The concept of a "proof" may be new to many of students. But it is the power and the beauty of Mathematics. Once you prove something correctly,  nobody can disprove it, no matter how smart your opponent is.
* Mathematics is not only about calculating something. It is more about finding order in the world, connecting things that seem unconnected.
