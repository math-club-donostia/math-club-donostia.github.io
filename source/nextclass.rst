Nearest Sessions
++++++++++++++++++

.. _sec-nextclass:

Each session is a separate event, accessible both to newcomers and those that attended previous sessions.
It is important to **fill the form for every session** (see below). This helps us to prepare properly.
If you are planning to come, but not completely sure, better fill form is advance, and later notify if you cannot come.

Normally, it is on Sunday morning and Monday evening (see below), but please check this page later for updates.

On Monday session we do not start a new topic, but reuse older problem lists. So please come, to complete those Sunday
sessions that you missed (or if you could not attend any of them). Those, who completed all problems from all previous
sessions are also welcome, I will find something for you also.

**April 28th (Sunday) - DIPC**
------------------------------

* Registration form `form <https://forms.gle/vbQfQVAv5SGKU3jQ8>`__

* **Schedule**:
    - 10:00 - 11:30  - Problem solving - younger group (LH4 and younger)
    - 11:30 - 11:45  - Picoteo for the younger group
    - 11:45 - 12:45  - Video club  (both groups together)
    - 12:45 - 13:00  - Picoteo for the elder group
    - 13:00 - 14:30  - Problem Solving - elder group (LH5 and older)

    This separation by age is flexible (but recommended). If you cannot attend at the time specified for your age group,
    or if two siblings want to come at the same time, it is allowed to come with the other group. In any case the student
    will get problems in accordance with his/her age and capabilities. However, it is more comfortable to be with children
    of similar age.
