Math Olympiads in Spain
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _sec-olyspain:

When I was at my school age in Siberia I enjoyed participating in Olympiads in Mathematics and Physics.
In Russia, enthusiastic teachers are gathering talented children in math clubs (usually held on weekends,
and therefore called "Sunday [mathematical] schools". There are also summer mathematical camps implemented both
on regional and national level.

Unfortunately, Math-olympic movement in Spain is more limited, however there are:

* `Olimpiada Matemática Española <https://www.rsme.es/olimpiada-matematica-espanola/>`__  - for the older students , ca 18 y.o
* Olimpiada matemática de Euskadi `"Eduardo Chillida" <https://sites.google.com/view/olinpiadachillida/>`__ for 2º de ESO
* Olimpiada Nacional `Junior <https://fespm.es/index.php/2023/07/01/2023-tenerife/>`__ for 2º de ESO
* International `Canguro <https://canguromat.es/>`__  Olympiads for ESO and Bachillerato.

Among the activities in Spain, similar to our club:

* `TALLER DE MATEMÁTICAS <https://www.ehu.eus/olimpiadamat/>`__ in Bilbao, for students of bachillerato
* `ESTALMAT <https://www.estalmat.org/>`__ project, for 11-12 years old, but not present in the Basque Country.
* `Taller de Talento Matemático <http://www.unizar.es/ttm>`__ in Zaragoza
