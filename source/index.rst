Introduction
=====================


What we do
++++++++++++++++++

We organize regular meetings (around 2-3 hours every weeekend) to solve tricky (olympiad-style) mathematical problems,
talk about mathematics beyond the school program, and also watch and discuss popular science :ref:`videos <sec-video>`.
The difficulty level (and language, upon possibility) is adjusted individually to each participant.
However, our main goal is not (only) to win an olympiad.

Our Goals
---------------

* Have fun with math!
* show the kids the beauty of mathematics
* develop creativity and non-standard thinking
* Train for Mathematical olympiads
* Create a community of curious kids

Teachers
++++++++

Lead by :ref:`Stepan Tsirkin <sec-stepan>`, PhD in Physics, Ikerbasque Research Fellow at CFM.
Other researchers scientific researchers also join.
The project is fully based on volunreering. The teachers (including me) participate at their own initiative,
apart from their main work, without extra payment.  Our motivation is to collaborate to create a unique environment
for the benefit of our own children.

Therefore we **encourage parents to also assist as teachers**. One does NOT need to be a professional mathematician,
nor a scientist/engineer or anything like that, neither to have very deep mathematical knowledge.
Just a bit of curiosity, some instructions from me and you are ready to go!
If your children can solve these problems - you also can!

If you feel capable consider becoming a teacher or teaching assistant.

Languages
++++++++++

The main languages are Spanish and English,
Printouts are provided in Spanish, English and Russian.

I also speak Russian and some German. Other teachers may speak other languages.
We aim to build an international multi-language community.

Age of participants
+++++++++++++++++++++

We welcome children from 1st year of Primary education, up to (and including) Bachillerato. Younger children
also may come and ennjoy, although we do not prepare specifically for them.

Time and place
+++++++++++++++

Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC)  `map <https://maps.app.goo.gl/gQCwwBtMxdog811S8>`__
