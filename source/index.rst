=====================
Introduction
=====================


What we aim to do
++++++++++++++++++

We plan to organize regular meetings (around 2 hours weekly) to solve tricky (olympiad-style) mathematical problems,
talk about mathematics beyond the school program, etc. The difficulty level (and language, upon possibility)
is adjusted individually to each participant.

When I was at my school age in Siberia I enjoyed participating in Olympiads in Mathematics and Physics.
In Russia, enthusiastic teachers are gathering talented children in math clubs (usually held on weekends,
and therefore called "Sunday [mathematical] schools". There are also summer mathematical camps implemented both
on regional and national level. Some of such activities are also implemented in :ref:`Spain <sec-olyspain>`,
but unfortunately not much in the Basque Country. So let's launch such activity.

Our Goals are
---------------

* Have fun with math!
* Develop creativity and non-standard thinking
* Train for Mathematical olympiads
* Create a community of curious kids


Teachers
++++++++

Lead by :ref:`Stepan Tsirkin <sec-stepan>`, PhD in Physics, Ikerbasque Research Fellow at CFM.

Other researchers scientific researchers may also join.

If you feel capable consider becoming a teacher or teaching assistant : |register|

Languages
++++++++++

I speak English, Spanish, Russian and some German.
Hopefully, some Basque-speaking teachers will join.
We aim to build an international multi-language community.

Age of participants
+++++++++++++++++++++

We mainly focus on the age group from 8 to 18, but slightly younger participants may also join.

Time and place
+++++++++++++++

Will be defined depending the number of interested participants and their preferred time. Please, fill the |register|

Registration
+++++++++++++

If you are interested, please fill the |register|, providing your contact details and convenient time.
You will be informed when the classes start.

There is no selection process,  everyone is welcome.
Participation is free. But we hope for the help of volunteers to make this event unforgettable,
so parents may register as helpers.

What we are not
+++++++++++++++++

We are NOT a math reinforcement class. We do not re-explain school math, we go beyond its limits.
