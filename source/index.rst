====================
Introduction
====================


What we aim to do
++++++++++++++++++

When I was at my school age in Siberia I enjoyed participating in Olympiads in Mathematics and Physics.
In Russia, enthusiastic teachers are gathering talented children in math clubs (usually held on weekends,
and therefore called "Sunday [mathematical] schools". There are also summer mathematical camps implemented both
on regional and national level. Some of such activities are also implemented in :ref:`Spain <sec-olyspain>`,
but unfortunately not much in the Basque Country

We plan to organize regular meetings to solve tricky (olympiad-style) mathematical problems.
The difficulty level is adjusted individually to each participants.

Our Goals are
---------------

* Have fun with math!
* Develop creativity and non-standard thinking
* Train for Mathematical olympiads
* Create a community of curious kids


Teachers
++++++++

Lead by |stepan|, PhD in Physics, Ikerbasque Research Fellow at CFM.

Other researchers scientific researchers may also join.
If you feel capable consider becoming a teacher or teaching assistant : |register|

Languages
++++++++++

I speak English, Spanish, Russian and some German.
Hopefully, some Basque-speaking teachers will join.
We aim to build an international multi-language community.

Age of participants
+++++++++++++++++++++

We mainly focus on the age group from 8 to 18, but slightly younger participants may also join.

You will be informed when the classes start.

There is no selection process,  Everyone is welcome.
Participation is free.

What we are not
+++++++++++++++++

We are NOT a math reinforcement class. We do not re-explain school math, we go beyond its limits.
